This is an EP I tried to put together as fast as possible, so to ensure I would enjoy the process. It's very grimy and moody, I like to think!
I went for "ugly" sounds this time around, since I've noticed I have a tendency to fall into a "pretty" soundscape typically.
This thing was made quickly and aggressively and I like to think that comes through in a good way.
[You can buy it on bandcamp](https://voidfemmes.bandcamp.com/album/all-fours)

Hope you like it! As always, sharing helps me immensely â™¥

I should also note that if you want to buy this record and you don't want Bandcamp to take 15%, you can buy it directly from [my online store :)](https://shop.voidfemmes.ca/products/all-fours-album)

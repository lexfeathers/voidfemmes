An electronic odyssey through space and transformation.
This song was written and produced in collaboration with <a href="https://erincorbett.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Erin Corbett.</a>

Lyrics:
```
In the dark I found a passage through
to navigate the stars in search of you
Hunting like a virus; astral flow
Drifting to the center's anti-glow

Won't be coming back from this one
Taken by its pull
If you're even there, what are you?
I need to know your form
```

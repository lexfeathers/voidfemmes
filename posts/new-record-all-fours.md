    This is an EP I tried to put together as fast as possible, so to ensure I would enjoy the process. It's very grimy and moody, I like to think!
    I went for "ugly" sounds this time around, since I've noticed I have a tendency to fall into a "pretty" soundscape
    typically.
    This thing was made quickly and aggressively and I like to think that comes through in a good way.

    Hope you like it! As always, sharing helps me immensely â™¥

    I should also note that if you want to buy this record and you don't want Bandcamp to take 15%, you can buy it
    directly from [my online store :)](https://shop.voidfemmes.ca/products/all-fours-album)

### Void Femmes is a project by Lex Feathers.
There's not much to say other than WOW WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS SITE AND HUH LOOK AT THAT, 
A `FLOAT: RIGHT` IMAGE!
<figure class="right">
  <img src="/assets/images/oofeyes.jpg" alt="A painting of a woman staring a book she's reading with wide, incredulous eyes."> 
  <figcaption>Woah. Just wow.</figcaption>
</figure>

What an interesting and silly way to do things in 2024! I'm just so quirky and cute that way. My understanding is that you're not supposed to use float unless you're trying to work an image in line in a magazine layout, where the text flows around the object. WELL DOOFUS, THAT'S WHAT I'M DOING NOW.

I am so tired.

Please let me just have a website. This is what happens when you want a website and say "I'll just make one myself. Shouldn't take too long!"
But it did take too long. I keep rewriting this thing and starting over. I never get to the point where I actually add anything to the site.

What would you do????? I'm really not sure.
Anyway I've got a CMS running and now I'm posting with it!
